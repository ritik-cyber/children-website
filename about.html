          <p>

            participating in games. The fun that comes with them is enough to
            improve your mood and make you more productive. You will also fight
            lifestyle diseases if you are active in games.

          <p>
            The trips to the doctor will reduce, and life will be more
            fulfilling. They can be either outdoor or indoor. There are those
            that will engage your mind and make your brain active and more
            productive. Others are more physical, and they aim to strengthen
            your body and help burn any excess fat.

        <h2>improve your mental health</h2>
        <p>
          Some of the things that affect your mental health are increased
          pressure and too much psychological fatigue. Life comes with a share
          of problems to deal with every day. You may complete handling an issue
          today, and just when you are about to celebrate, another one comes up.
          It may look like life is always about handling challenges and making
          difficult decisions. The only way to enjoy sanity is to keep engaging
          in games. Some of the games that will boost your mental health are
          escape rooms.
        </p>

        </p>
        <h2>Break from a monotonous life</h2>
        <p>
          Routine is too boring for an adventurous and free spirit. Being
          confined to the same kind of life daily can make you lack the psych to
          perform your duties or achieve goals. Organise a tournament with your
          colleagues and enjoy a wonderful time together. Instead of spending
          time stuck in traffic, go for an indoor or an outdoor game. Form teams
          and display your prowess in sports or in that escape room game.
        </p>
        <h2>Build tolerance</h2>
        <p>
          A muscular physique is desirable and healthy. You will enjoy a healthy
          brain and will look at life from a different perspective. Increased
          rates of crime and unethical practices occur because of failure to
          accommodate each otherâ€™s opinions. Sporting helps promote peaceful
          coexistence among people in the society.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your body will be pushed to the furthest limit but still, endure the
          intense activities that come with sports. Doing it regularly helps
          promote a strong brain and body. When you go out with your friends to
          play a game such as football, you will compete against each other but
          feel fulfilled and closer to each other by the end of the game. Each
          team member will work towards achieving the best results for the team.
          A mind engaging game such as an escape room or chess will push your
          brain to think critically thus increasing the threshold of your mental
          capabilities.
